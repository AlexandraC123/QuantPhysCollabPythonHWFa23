BME4409 Quantitative Physiology - Fall 2023
For the Assignment - Establishing a collaborative python environment, you are charged with two tasks: (1) downloading and installing python (which will come in useful later in the semester when you use Neuron) and (2) contributing to a collaborative coding repository. This assignment is to help establish best practices for creating a collaborate coding environment, which will be important as you start working on your Semester Project.

Task 1: Download and install python

Install Python 3.11. There are many potential choices of ways to do this, but the easiest is likely using Anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individualLinks to an external site.
At the bottom of the page you will find "Anaconda Installers"
Download the Anaconda Individual Edition that is appropriate for your computer
Documentation for installing on Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/Links to an external site.
Documentation for installing on macOS: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/Links to an external site.
Documentation for installing on Linux: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/Links to an external site.
Screenshot your successful installation to turn in.
Create your first python script with Anaconda
Follow along with Getting started with Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/Links to an external site.
Complete a modified version of the Run Python in Spyder IDE for your sample python code that will be used in Task 2.
Install Spyder from the Applications pane
Launch Spyder
In a new file on the left, delete any placeholder text, then type or copy/paste:
print(“Hello Quantitative Physiology Class”)
Hint: if you receive a SyntaxError, try typing the text instead of copying and pasting
In the top menu, click File – Save As and name your program as “LastName_FirstScript.py”
where LastName should be replaced by your last name, so for Dr. Otto the sample code would be “Otto_FirstScript.py”
Run your new program by clicking the triangle Run button.
You should be able to see your program’s output in the bottom right of the Console pane.
To close Spyder, go to the top menu bar, select Spyder – Quit Spyder.
 

Task 2: Create a collaborative coding environment with your group

Complete the five steps in Part 1: Configuring your GitHub account in the GitHub Docs 
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#part-1-configuring-your-github-accountLinks to an external site.
Watch the "Introduction to GitHub" at GitHub Skills: 
https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-githubLinks to an external site.
Dr. Otto (@kevin-otto) has created a repository called QuantPhysCollabPythonHWFa23
https://github.com/kevin-otto/QuantPhysCollabPythonHWFa23Links to an external site.
Using the workflow outlined in the First Day on GitHub Learning Path, upload your sample python code from Task 1 into this repository
Optional: Download and use GitHubDesktop for managing your collaborative coding environment: https://desktop.github.com/Links to an external site.
 

You will be evaluated by completing these two tasks through (a) uploading screenshots of successful python installation on your laptop on Canvas (10pts) and (2) successfully contributing your sample python code to the QuantPhysCollabPythonHWFa23 repository (10pts) before the deadline.
